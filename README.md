Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
The process of designing, developing and maintaining software.


Which of the following describes software engineering? 
The process of designing, developing and maintaining software.
It ensures a software system meets the user requirements and produces high-quality software solutions.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Early programming languages- Languages such as COBOL allowed programmers to write instructions in a more human readable form.
Structured programming - Languages like pascal encouraged programmers to break down complex tasks into smaller more manageable pieces.
Adoption of agile methodologies - These include extreme programming which emphasized iterative development, collaboration and flexibility.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - Gathering and analyzing user needs 
Design - Creating architecture of the system 
Development - Where coding takes place and the project is brought to life
Testing - Making sure everything works as expected 
Deployment - Means putting the software live, where users can start using it.
Maintenance - Keeping the software running smoothly 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins while agile methodology is an iterative, flexible and adaptation.
Waterfall can be used in infrastructure projects while agile in rapidly changing markets.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer designs, writes and maintains code to build software applications.
A quality assurance engineer tests software to identify and fix defects.
A project manager oversees the project, coordinates tasks, manages timelines and budgets and ensures successful delivery.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a comprehensive environment for coding, debugging and testing. Its examples include eclipse and visual studio.
VCS enables collaborative development, track changes and maintain code history ensuring code integrity. It includes git and mercurial.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with rapid technological changes- Continuous learning through online courses.
Debugging complex code- Use debugging tools and break down the problem into smaller parts.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing tests individual units or components of a software - Ensures that each part of the code works correctly.
Integration testing tests the interaction between integrated units or components - It verifies that different modules or services work together as expected.
System testing tests the complete and integrated software system - It ensures that the system meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance testing is conducted to determine if the software meets the end-users needs - Validates that the software is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to effectively interact with AI models.
It ensures that the AI provides accurate, relevant and useful responses to user inputs.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about the weather 
Improved prompt: Can you provide a detailed weather forecast for Nairobi, Kenya, including precipitation and temperatures for the past two days.
Explanation: The improved prompt is clear, specific and providing detailed requirements which leads to more accurate and relevant responses.
